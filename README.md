# chunk-manifest-webpack-plugin

Allows exporting a JSON file that maps chunk ids to their resulting asset files. Webpack can then read this mapping, assuming it is provided somehow on the client, instead of storing a mapping (with chunk asset hashes) in the bootstrap script, which allows to actually leverage long-term caching.

##### This repo was (lovingly) forked from [soundcloud/chunk-manifest-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/soundcloud/chunk-manifest-webpack-plugin).

## Usage

Install via npm:

```shell
npm install --save-dev chunk-manifest-webpack-plugin
```

Install via yarn:

```shell
yarn add --dev chunk-manifest-webpack-plugin
```

And then require and provide to webpack:

```javascript
// in webpack.config.js or similar
const ChunkManifestPlugin = require('chunk-manifest-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  // your config values here
  plugins: [
    new ChunkManifestPlugin({
      filename: 'manifest.json',
      manifestVariable: 'webpackManifest',
      inlineManifest: false
    })
  ]
};
```

### Options

#### `filename`

Where the manifest will be exported to on bundle compilation. This will be relative to the main webpack output directory. Default = `"manifest.json"`

#### `manifestVariable`

What JS variable on the client webpack should refer to when requiring chunks. Default = `"webpackManifest"`

#### `inlineManifest`

Whether or not to write the manifest output into the [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin). Default = `false`

```html
// index.ejs
<body>
    <!-- app -->
    <%= htmlWebpackPlugin.files.webpackManifest %>
</body>
```
